# Deforestation Detection with KNN

This repository contains a Python script that performs the classification of satellite images in order to detect deforestation areas. The application leverages the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to detect deforestation patches and highlight them in red for easy visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x:** Make sure Python 3 and pip are installed on your system. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **NumPy:** This application requires the NumPy library to handle image data.

You can install numpy using pip:

`pip install numpy`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joaotav/satellite-deforestation-detection.git
   ```

## Usage

To classify an image, execute the script using the following command:
```
python3 detect_deforestation.py <image.ppm> <k_value> <block_size>
```
**Where:**
   - **<image.ppm>**: Path to the PPM image file you want to classify.
   - **<k_value>**: Value for k in the kNN algorithm, which determines the number of nearest neighbors considered for classification.
   - **<block_size>**: Size of the blocks the image is divided into for patch analysis, smaller numbers increase the precision of classification but require longer execution times.

**Example:**

```
python3 detect_deforestation.py sattellite_img.ppm 16 2
```

This will separate the image into blocks of 2x2 pixels and classify them using a `k_value` of 16.
The classified output will be saved as `output.ppm`.

## Example Classification:

### Input image (Classified using `k_value` = 16 and `block_size` = 1):
